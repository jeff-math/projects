My name is Jefferson Mathews, I am currently at Senior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign graduating in May with a B.S. in Statistics and a minor in Recreation, Sport and Tourism. This repo is meant to showcase previous work I have completed to showcase my talents in data analysis, visualization, and management.
